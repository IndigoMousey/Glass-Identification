# Glass-Identification
Uses a random forest classifier to predict kinds of glass based on their elemental composition. Because of unbalanced data, I used balanced classes to prevent low presence classes from being ignored. Data was gotten off of Kaggle. Has an accuracy or .953 with an out-of-bag score of .753
